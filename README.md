# CrestronProjectTemplate

This repository contains a `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` file defined for creating projects

`.gitattributes` is used to define certain files as binaries so git version control doesn't throw errors

`.gitignore` prevents all compiled or temporary files from being staged in git commits as they are unnecessary for source control
